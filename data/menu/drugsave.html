<p>Even when someone comes to terms with the fact that they have a drug problem, it can be difficult for them to change their situation. You may need to be patient. If they aren't ready to seek help, the support you can offer will be limited to trying to minimise the impact that their drug use has on them and others around them.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="heart.png" class="img-circle" width="30%"></div>
<p>If the person you care for has started to think about their situation and the negative effects of their drug use, you may be able to help by letting them know about the support that's available to them.</p>

<p>When someone has chosen to seek help with their drug use, they may be anxious about what's in store for them. One way that you could support them is by being understanding about how they're feeling, while encouraging them in the changes they've chosen to make.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="support.png" width="30%"></div>
<p>For many people, taking action to deal with their drug use is just the start, and maintaining the changes they've made may be the most difficult part. Recognising situations that could trigger their drug use, and trying to avoid these, could help. If the person you care for does lapse back into drug use, you can encourage them to seek help, for example by keeping in contact with local support services.</p>

<p>If the person you care for continues to use drugs despite the support you provide, this can be very frustrating and demoralising. Remember, the decision to use drugs is their responsibility, not yours, and make sure you seek help for yourself as a carer.</p>
